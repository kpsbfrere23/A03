How to use Git/Git hub with webstorm
INSTALLING WEBSTORM
     The first step of the process would be to install webstorm
DO not download webstorm from the normal link given on the website. Doing so will only allow you to use a 30 day license. Instead create a jet brains account with njit.edu or edu emmail account.
Using this link: https://www.jetbrains.com/student/4

   It will ask whether you are a student or teacher and after filling in the required fiels will send you an email. Insinde that email there will be a link that will give you the right version of webstorm. In doing so the app will give you access to all the needed features for a full year for free
Installing Git
   The next step is to install Git on your laptop or device
Using this link https://git-scm.com/downloads 
   where it will ask the kind of machine you have apple,window or linux
After clicking on the appropriate model download the app and install it on a file that you will remember as you will need it later on
Creating GitHub account

After installing Git, google create Git hub account  or use this link https://github.com/join in order to link it to webstorm and use Git
Use your school email to create your GitHub  account and make it public for everyone to see
THis GitHub account  will be used in the future as not only part of  your portfolio that will be made by you but also as a reference of any projects thay will be completed in your time as a student


After installing both webstorm and GitHub onto your local machine
Go into webstorm and press Ctrl+Alt+S
This will lead you to webstorm's settings
Scroll down and look for something labeled as version control. Select on version control and click on Git.
Remembering what file Git was installed in click on path to Git executable and select the file that git.exe is in

After connecting GitHub to Webstorm, Scroll up to appearance and behavior.
There select passwords and add a password file for your GitHub and Webstorm

Creating a GitHub Repository
The next and very important step of this process is to create a repository.
Go to the GitHub website and sign in with your email.
After signing in, In the top right corner  there will be a little plus sign or cross next to your profile picture or avatar.
click on it and then click new repository. After creating the repository and giving it a name 
Make a read me file for future users
Now go back to webstorm and create a **repository** there too

Go to vcs which is at the top bar of the app right next to tools,
and create a repository for git and give it a name

From the main page select check out from **version control** and import that repository from Github.
Give it a name and select the path to the file which should be git.demo

After creating the repository go to file in the top left corner and create a html file
When naming the file from HTML, don't forget to make it lowercase for the first letter

Not making it lowercase could lead to future problems.
Also create a complete a separate file for the project to make it easier to track and manage

After creating the html 5 file it will open a add file dialog to add it to the local system
After doing all these steps the vcs should be replaced by git.
Click on Git and  click on commit for  all the changes just made.

Add a message that should say base file

After **committing** press alt ctrl +k or push in order to finish the commiting process

After Go to the webpage in order to check the setting which should have the right name of the files and path. 
It should also be on public in order for other people to see 
Put the files in the master **branch** too.
